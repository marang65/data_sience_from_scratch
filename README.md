# Data Sience from Scratch (First Principles with Python)
This Repository is my own source code to the book of Joel Grus.

## Prerequisites
I used [Anaconde](https://www.anaconda.com/) for development. It offers a complete package for data science development.

After installing Anaconda, I recommend creating your own Python environment. I used Python 3.12

```
conda --name <Your Enviroment Name> python=3.12
conda activate <Your Enviroment Name>
```
Then happy coding.
